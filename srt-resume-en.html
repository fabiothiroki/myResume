							<p>
								Hi, I'm a mobile developer focused on native mobile development
								(Android and iOS), and happy to have shipped successfully great apps.
								I like working in a team, crafting software to improve the life of
								end-users. I believe software development can be enjoyable
								and meaningful. I also believe study can be a form of entertainment.
								<!-- Software developer with 3+ years of experience in mobile development. My main focus is in both Android and iOS platforms, in which I have successful published apps. Highly interested in agile development, software quality, process improvement and people management. -->

							<h2>Knowledge</h2>
						</div>
						<div class="yui-u">
							<p>
								I develop apps using <b>Java</b> in Android, and <b>Swift</b>
								 and <b>Objective-C</b> in iOS. As they are object-oriented languages,
								I am careful to create clean and mainatable code, mainly by applying
								<b>SOLID Principles</b> and <b>Design Patterns</b>. I have studied and
								experienced ways to improve the development flow, like <b>Continuous
								Integration</b> (travis-ci), different architectures
								(<b>Model-View-Presenter</b>), which also allows better <b>Unit Tests</b>.
